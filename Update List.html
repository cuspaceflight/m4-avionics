<h2>
Component upgrades
</h2>
<p>
Several components in m4-core-avionics are deprecated, and therefore no longer sold by Farnell. <br>
This is a list of suggested replacements. The various schematics should be updated shortly.
<p>
<button class="collapsible">Methodology</button>
<div class="content">
1. Each schematic in m4-core-avionics had a "Bill of Materials" generated.<br>
2. These files were then searched to produce the list of Farnell order numbers used.<br>
3. The associated Farnell web pages were then visited.<br>
4. The following set of criteria were applied to determine if a component should be upgraded:<br>
<ul><li>
	Any component out of stock/no longer stocked/..... was upgraded.<br>
</li>
<li>
	Any component which was "on sale until stocks were exhausted" was upgraded, on the grounds that, by the time Martlet 4 flies, they will be out of stock.<br>
</li>
<li>
	Conversely, any component on back-order was ignored, on the grounds that the back-order will have arrived by the time the rocket is being assembled, they should be back in stock.<br>
</li>
</ul>
5. Those components which had to be upgraded had upgrades chosen on a case-by-case basis. Frequently Farnell would suggest a replacement, or otherwise a replacement which matched the necessary requirements could be found using Farnell custom search.
<div style="font-size:5px;">No components were harmed in the making of this report.</div>

<td colspan="3" style="text-align:center;">
I am currently recommending we do not replace this component, as the termpertature datalogging section of m4dl depends heavily on it, and no slot-in replacement exists. I suggest it would be a dispropotionate burden of effort to replace it, as opposed to simply buying some of the remaining stock.

<td colspan="3">
Despite Farnell showing this component is deprecated, its manufacturer, Analog systems, states it is still in production and claims to have >1000 instances of this component left. For this reason, and given that no slot-in replacement could be found, I am recommending we keep using it.
